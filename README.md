## Development Projects:
### [Cisco Intersight Account Reset Tool (Python)](https://ugo-emekauwa.github.io/intersight-account-reset-tool/)
The Cisco Intersight Account Reset Tool is designed to increase the efficiency of developers, engineers, sellers and trainers working with Cisco Intersight by automating the Intersight account reset process.

The Cisco Intersight Account Reset Tool will automatically remove any devices, profiles, policies and/or users created under an Intersight account. By removing the burden of having to manually reset accounts, the Cisco Intersight Account Reset Tool enables more time to be spent on other tasks. For developers and engineers building applications and platforms for Cisco Intersight, the development and testing process of new features is simplified. For sellers and trainers demonstrating the Cisco Intersight product, downtime between customer or student engagements is reduced. The Cisco Intersight Account Reset Tool also has the ability to exempt specified users and devices from the account reset process.

Use of the Cisco Intersight Account Reset Tool is at your own risk and intended for development, testing, demonstration and training environments. Please do not use on production systems.


### [Cisco Intersight Universal API Calls (Python)](https://ugo-emekauwa.github.io/intersight-universal-api-calls/)
The Cisco Intersight Universal API Calls module provides a set of functions that simplify creation, retrieval, modification, and deletion of resources on Cisco Intersight. Any available API types listed in the Cisco Intersight API Reference library can be accessed, including those which do not yet have a specific module in the Intersight SDK for Python.


### [HyperFlex Notification Tool for Cisco Intersight (Python)](https://ugo-emekauwa.github.io/hyperflex-notification-tool/)
The HyperFlex Notification Tool (HXNT) provides email alert notifications on the status of Cisco HyperFlex Edge cluster deployments through Cisco Intersight. No longer do you have to manually check or monitor the Intersight web interface to find out the status of your deployments. HXNT will automatically provide updates on HyperFlex deployment completions, task failures, required pending changes, and missing HyperFlex cluster profiles.
